                    <span class="first-letter">I</span> was heartbroken to hear the news of the fatal helicopter crash
                    that caused the death of legendary
                    Kobe Bryant, along with his daughter Gigi and seven others. As soon as I heard the news, I was
                    shocked. I couldn’t believe it and didn’t want to. I checked to make sure it wasn’t fake. When it
                    was confirmed, I spent the rest of the day in sort of this haze, reflecting on Kobe’s legacy and our
                    brief time together. Kobe inspired me for years, and I know he inspired so many other people across
                    the world. My heart goes out to his family and the families of those involved with the crash. There
                    are no words to express my sadness, and I can’t imagine what those families are going through right
                    now. When I interviewed Kobe in 2018, I asked him what love was, and he described love as “a journey
                    that has its ups and its downs…it’s a certain persistence to go through the good times and the bad
                    times with someone or something that you truly love.” Even though Kobe is no longer with us, I know
                    that his legacy of love and greatness will continue to inspire and strengthen us for years to come.
                    In this episode, I wanted to revisit our previous interview together to remember his testament of
                    greatness. Kobe was a champion, and to be a champion, you have to have the champion mentality. He
                    also was a kind man, a caring father, and he changed the world for the better. To be great is rare
                    enough. To be great and kind is rarer still.

                    Who Was Kobe Bryant?

                    Kobe is widely regarded as one of the best basketball players of all time.

                    He won five NBA championships with the Lakers and led the NBA in scoring during two seasons. He was
                    an 18-time All-Star, 15-time member of the All-NBA Team, 12-time member of the All-Defensive Team.
                    He holds the NBA record for the most seasons played with one franchise for an entire career: 20
                    seasons with the Los Angeles Lakers.

                    In addition to being a pro-athlete, Kobe was also a storyteller. In 2018, he received an Academy
                    Award for his animated short “Dear Basketball.” He also launched a podcast called The Punies that
                    teaches kids morals and history in a really fun way.

                    Kobe was known for his Mamba Mentality, but it’s his big heart that is truly admirable. He was
                    constantly reinventing himself and continuing to pursue new dreams.

                    If you’ve been following Kobe for years, then you most likely know about all his amazing
                    achievements. I want to share a story about when I first met Kobe.

                    I was so thrilled to come interview him – it was the biggest interview I had ever done at the time.
                    I didn’t have too much time to prepare, but I was ready to jump on it. I wanted to get the most out
                    of this interview because I knew that it was going to be fantastic.

                    We arrived at his office at around 6:30AM, and I walked around with his assistant to find an ideal
                    spot for filming. As we were walking down the dark, empty halls, I looked into this one office and
                    see a figure in the back corner, looking up at the ceiling.

                    That was Kobe.

                    He was in the office at 6:45 A.M. He was just there. Lights off and everything. Not on his phone or
                    computer. Just sitting.

                    He had been there since 5:00 am. He was preparing for our interview and the rest of his insanely
                    busy day. His assistant told me that he was always the first one in the office and the last one out.

                    Now, here’s a man who has done it all. At this time he had already won an Oscar. He’s already
                    achieved so many things. He had nothing else to prove to the world, but here he was, the first one
                    in the office, ready to get to work.

                    That really impressed me.

                    What also impressed me was his transparency. When I asked Kobe if there were things we needed to
                    avoid in our interview, he looked me dead in the eyes and said:

                    “You can ask me anything you want.”

                    I knew it was going to be a great interview. Kobe opened up about things he had never talked about
                    publicly before. He was so gracious, so giving and so caring. During the interview, he never made me
                    feel uncomfortable, nervous, or intimidated. He was truly a great and kind man.

                    I want to share this interview with you as a testament to his life, his legacy, and the love he left
                    for all of us.
