                    <span class="first-letter">T</span>he day he celebrated his 30th birthday, Kobe Bryant gave me a
                    present.

                    If it seemed surreal at the time, it seems doubly so today, with the world in shock at the loss of
                    this man.

                    Kobe Bryant died in a helicopter crash in California on Sunday. Although I thanked him for his
                    graciousness that night we met, I couldn’t have known then all that I needed to thank him for.

                    I was Mr. Nobody, you understand.

                    He was Kobe Bryant, the star of stars at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.


                    And all I wanted from him was an exclusive interview for The Palm Beach Post.

                    At 2 o’clock in the morning.

                    Yes, that interview really did take place, in a dark and deserted arena in the middle of nowhere in
                    China. I came away with quotes for a story on the enormous popularity Kobe enjoyed in China,
                    popularity that had the other supposed stars on that Dream Team at a loss for words.

                    I also came away with an appreciation for how humble Kobe Bryant was. If you tripped over that
                    phrase, linking Kobe and humility, maybe you’re not alone, I don’t know.

            <div class="second-text">

                <p>
                    Here’s what I do know: The setting was the USA’s 101-81 victory over defending champion Argentina,
                    which sent the Americans into a gold-medal game they’d also win. Oddly enough, the U.S.-Argentina
                    game began at 10 p.m. local time, the end of a day in which I’d attended three events that were
                    duds. I hadn’t written a word all day. The basketball game was my last hope.

                    In the opening seconds, Kobe drove the lane, leaped, and realized he had no shot. So Kobe did what
                    Kobe does. He hung in the air so long, the guy guarding him succumbed to gravity. Kobe hit the
                    basket. The place went nuts, and I knew it was time to cash in on an idea I had in my back pocket:
                    on Kobe’s crazy popularity with the Chinese.

                    I watched the game with Craig Miller, press officer for USA Basketball, who was on board with the
                    idea, feeding me background. When the game ended, I went to the “mixed zone,” the area where
                    reporters can ask questions of players as they shuffle into the locker room.

                    Jason Kidd said Kobe’s popularity was Elvis and Michael Jackson rolled into one.

                    Chris Paul said, “Everybody on our team probably thought we were somebody till we got over here.
                    Kobe is unbelievable. MVP of the NBA this year, but no way he’s bigger in the States than he is here
                    in China.”

                    Dwyane Wade said he was loving how Kobe afforded him comparative anonymity, and LeBron James said,
                    “Kobe is the No. 1 athlete out here. It’s unbelievable. Beyond basketball. I think people are
                    starting to see his personality.”

                    I wasn’t prepared for what I was about to learn of Kobe’s personality. I was under the impression
                    Kobe could be one of the more difficult subjects for anyone with a notepad and pen, understandable
                    coming a few years after he’d endured rape allegations that eventually led to charges being dropped.

                    Eventually, that mixed zone emptied. In fact, the entire arena did, except for me, Miller and Kobe,
                    who was nowhere in sight. With a long face, Miller informed me Kobe had been selected for random
                    drug testing and was having trouble producing a sample.

                    The healthy sweat Kobe had broken during the game was akin to the one I was breaking waiting.

                    I had no doubt that when Kobe finally emerged, and Miller whispered what Mr. Nobody was hanging
                    around for, Kobe was going to blow me off.



                    But he didn’t blow me off. Not only did he talk to me, he was friendly, engaging, and humble to the
                    point that I stopped him and remarked how blown away he seemed at the fans.

                    “One night we had a big storm,” he told me. “It was raining and the bus was leaving our hotel to
                    come here to the game and there’s still people outside with Kobe signs and posters. No ponchos. Just
                    chasing after the bus and screaming.

                    “And that’s when my teammates realized it’s pretty different.”

                    I asked him to explain it.

                    “I have no idea,” he said. “I was always popular here, but this summer in particular has been
                    something that I can’t explain.”

            <div class="first-text">
                <p>

                    It wasn’t just the fans. U.S. gymnast Alicia Sacramone excitedly texted friends to let them know she
                    just saw Kobe. “Leave me alone,” came the replies. It was the middle of the night.

                    Kobe was the subject of a text by U.S. sprinter Tyson Gay, too.

                    “Kobe asked about my leg!” Gay, who was battling a hamstring injury, informed his mother.

                    That U.S.-Argentina game took place on Aug. 22, 2008, but my audience with Kobe occurred in the wee
                    hours of Aug. 23 — his 30th birthday.

                    The gift he gave me: Don’t get too wrapped up in reputations, innuendo and others’ opinions. How
                    people treat you — especially when they don’t have to — should be your lasting impression of them.

                    And that’s why, when I learned of Kobe’s passing Sunday afternoon, hours passed before the thought
                    occurred to me that we’d lost one of the greatest basketball talents ever.

                    I couldn’t stop thinking about the loss of Kobe Bryant, the man.
